Then, we connect a directed edge from $l_t$ in a subgraph without the key card $t$ to the same vertex in a subgraph with it, which means we now own the key to pass corresponding doors next time. Finally, we apply BFS from the original entrance/exit (in the subgraph with no key) to get the minimum distance from entrance/exit to each pizza, and we apply BFS on the reverse graph from each entrance/exit to each pizza. We return the pizza with minimum $dis(e_0, p_i) + dis(p_i, e_k)$."
